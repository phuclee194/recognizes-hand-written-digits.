# recognizes-hand-written-digits.
Develop a method that recognizes hand written digits. A scan of a handwritten digit is stored as a 8 by 8 pixel grayscale bitmap. In order to develop this method you should learn a predictor that maps an 8 by 8 pixel grayscale bitmap to a predicted label (which is a number 0,1,2â€¦,9)

Try out at least logistic regression and linear regression. Compare all considered ML methods by computing the training and validation error using a 50/50 split, i.e., half of all data points is used for training and the other half for validation. The quality of a predictor should be measured as the fraction is misclassified digits i.e. the average number of data points for which the predicted label (digit) is different from the true label (digit). Compute this misclassification rate for both, the training set and the validation set.
